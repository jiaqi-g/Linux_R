The input file is read twice due to the "hidden file in the directory" !!!!!!

do not use special number in the input file... eg. use num 0 to represent special case
actually we should use "*" instead.

the large dataset may be imperfect. eg. there will be outsource nodes which does not goto any other nodes.
just consider this situation
